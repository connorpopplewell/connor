    debate on cell phones in class
I think cell phones should be available to use in class. many teachers believe that cell phones shouldn’t be in the class because they provide a distraction, but on a phone you can get a calculator, listen to music, and take photos and videos of important things in class. phones have many uses but still some teachers still disagree with this, but if we have our phones silenced and turned off, what’s the big problem? 
should be allowed
